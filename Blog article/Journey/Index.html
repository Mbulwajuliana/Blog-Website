 	In life It’s all about realizing that we all have the absolute power to bring something that was only in mind, into reality. We do not always see beyond the surface we tend to see what we feed our mind basically what we want to see.<br>As I read from the book 'Man's search for meaning' I realized that Frankl created a vision in his mind where he was with his wife and this brought him joy and happiness which was ironic given the current situation he was under at the concentration camp. With that I realized that we can go through many challenges in life but It's all about what you feed your mind, are you going to go through the challenge with a positive mindset that can actually get you through the hardships? or will you let negativity consume you to a point of no return?<br>We are all faced with these choices of how we want visualize our future and see beyond your current situation and to picture a better tomorrow, and for some they see the current situation and think that there cannot be a better tomorrow but It’s all about who you want to be and are you willing to see beyond...Seeing beyond the horizon.

 I believe in the great quote that has been passed down from school teacher to student that says <blockquote>'An idle mind is the devil’s workshop'</blockquote> and I definitely live by It to this day. As we are facing a tough time as a nation, we have seen so many things being put on hold. A situation we only dreamed about during preps in high school and hoped that one day schools get closed for a longer period than a month. We never thought It would be possible even without the regular strikes and frequent burning of school property, but here came a global pandemic that made It possible to a point staying at home has also become a concern for the student not even the math teacher who is counting the number of missed classes.<br>The whole situation has been crazy and painful to many but that doesn't mean we wait around for 2021 for things to go back to normal, and by now we can honestly realize that nothing is ever promised and maybe things will never go back to normal. This is the time to wake up and smell the coffee filled with opportunities at your fingertips and enough time, I literally say that time stopped in a way for you to discover yourself and for the ones who prayed for time. Well, you got It! As we take advantage of everyone being at home this is where you find what you love and nurture It to the fullest, as quarantine ends you shouldn't leave It the same way you started the mandatory quarantine and by that weight gain doesn’t count...’hahaha’. You should be a better version of who you were before the pandemic whether Its learning a new sport, reading 500 books or more, learning a new instrument, learning a new language, getting in shape or even gaining with 'tiktok' which I have realize has been the highlight of this year but who’s judging. Sauti Sol said in their Intro song to Midnight Train(I would totally recommend a listen to the Album Its totally a vibeeee!)<br>"Do what makes you happy<br>
Do what makes you smile<br>
Everybody is judging anyway<br>
You're only here for a while<br>
Raha usijinyime"<br>
<br>Enjoy what you do If you invested in something in the beginning of the year that you didn't feel like It completed your purpose why not take this time in solitude inside your house to nurture new skills that will get you ahead in 2021.Think about the future and <b>JUST DO IT</b>.</P>

 We say things have changed, I honestly thing Its the dates and the calendars that we keep changing. Our great ancestors fought for us and they fought for change, hope, freedom and peace but If they see what this country has become, they would definitely roll in their graves. We have made life more expensive for even the common ‘Mwananchi’. Life has become survival for the fittest and by fittest, I mean can you afford to survive?<br>
 Yes, the colonialist brought this upon us and we no longer live a life of everything belongs to the community  we a big part of It was brotherhood and sisterhood but we have literally taken advantage of the situation and we are all suffering. Funny thing we complain about the economy buy 20 years later we still haven’t relocated to better countries where the government is generous or a country with a better economy. It’s all about the need to survive and that’s all… 'all about getting with It' even the low class who unfortunately earn less will still need that packet of milk which the price has double recently and the amazing thing is that they always manage to buy Its cheaper than moving to another country It seems. It’s simple If you complain to change you will die.
 <br>We need to restructure our economy and push a petition where the basic necessities are affordable to all. But It all start with all of us to make that change, we go wrong expecting the people with no voice to voice our issues for all of us and If It doesn’t work, we all say we tried. Solidarity is all we need.<br><img src="https://elimufeynman.s3.amazonaws.com/media/resources/political_movements.JPG"><br>
 Once we were at war with the people who invaded our peace and decided to change our ways of living. Ancestors fought for justice and I honestly realized that these people were logical people. When the war claimed many live of their people, they decided that their time in our country was over, they packed and left. And this war was a war for fighting for right of the people, it’s sad to see that now we are inconstant war amongst ourselves. Someone who matches the color of your skin kills another and deprives them to the right to life, even worse the person who is supposed to protect you is literally the one who robs you and bashes your face. You can't run to the house of justice anymore everyone rather rants on social media with hashtags hoping that things would change but the sad truth It never does. We cannot be oppressed by our own and not do anything about It, we need to speak up without hiding behind social media and fight for equality.
